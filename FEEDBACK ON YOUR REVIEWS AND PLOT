very detailed and helpful reviews 10/10

NOTES ON YOUR PLOT
===================

labels too small

a compressed notation for the large numbers on the y axis would be a good choice to enhance readability

the square ration results in an empty plot. remember tufte's rules: ink to space ratio. a compressed y axis would be better and actually help comparison


NOTES ON THE PLOTS YOU REVIEWED
===========================================


ramdaffe
============


the use if size nicely displays the third variable. 
the size range for the datapoints is sensible: nice differential, not too large points not too small points

axis labels and tick labels, and legend  are nicely readable


"ln, person" is not clear what it means: just say "population (natural log - and are you sure it is not log10!!! in log 10 the orders of magnitude are displayed at regular intervals. usually we plot in log10: it is easy to relate 3 in log10 to 10^3=1000 but in ln?)"


Sachinve
============


the plot is a simple stacked histogram. 

labels are too small for readability, both tick labels and axis labels and title (which is also missing a space between word and parenthesis)

colorblind compliant


pbk236
============

the kind of plot that makes tufte happy. 
the author should make the python implementation public in a nice python module!
the color choices are not terribly good for color blind compliance.

what is the number at the top left of each row? not describes in the readme.
